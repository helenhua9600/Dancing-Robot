As a group of 4, we designed and created a dancing robot with six distinct dance moves and additional features. Our 6 dance moves were "Fancy Feet", "Foot Tap", "Up and Down", "UP AND DOWN!!!", "One Leg!", and "Three Steps and Shake!". The additional features were using a keypad for user input, background music, displaying its current state on an LCD screen and becoming a playable keyboard. To implement this, we used Circuit Python to control a Raspberry Pico Pi W, LEDs, an LCD screen, a keypad, 4 servo motors and a buzzer.

  ## Design and Implementation Details
  We used a keypad to receive user input and depending on what button the user pressed, different songs and dances would play. Using the song's original piano music, I arranged arrays of frequencies for the buzzer to play. Below is a block diagram and visual represention of the hardware's interaction with eachother:
